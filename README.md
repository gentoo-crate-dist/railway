## Translation

Railway can easily be translated for other languages, as it uses gettext. Please consider contributing translations using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/schmiddi-on-mobile/), as an alternative you can also open merge requests and I will notify you if updates are necessary. Thanks to Weblate for free hosting and all the translators for their great work keeping the translations up-to-date.
